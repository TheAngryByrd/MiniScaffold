### Developing

Make sure the following **requirements** are installed on your system:

- [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) 3.0 or higher
- [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) if you're on Linux or macOS.

or

- [VSCode Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)


---

### Environment Variables

- `CONFIGURATION` will set the [configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build?tabs=netcore2x#options) of the dotnet commands.  If not set, it will default to Release.
  - `CONFIGURATION=Debug ./build.sh` will result in `-c` additions to commands such as in `dotnet build -c Debug`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` will be used to upload release notes and nuget packages to github.
  - Be sure to set this before releasing
- `DISABLE_COVERAGE` Will disable running code coverage metrics.  AltCover can have [severe performance degradation](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/issues/57) so it's worth disabling when looking to do a quicker feedback loop.
  - `DISABLE_COVERAGE=1 ./build.sh`


---

### Building


```sh
> build.cmd <optional buildtarget> // on windows
$ ./build.sh  <optional buildtarget>// on unix
```

---

### Build Targets


- `Clean` - Cleans artifact and temp directories.
- `DotnetRestore` - Runs [dotnet restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore?tabs=netcore2x) on the [solution file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/solution-dot-sln-file?view=vs-2019).
- [`DotnetBuild`](#Building) - Runs [dotnet build](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build?tabs=netcore2x) on the [solution file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/solution-dot-sln-file?view=vs-2019).
- `DotnetTest` - Runs [dotnet test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test?tabs=netcore21) on the [solution file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/solution-dot-sln-file?view=vs-2019.).
- `GenerateCoverageReport` - Code coverage is run during `DotnetTest` and this generates a report via [ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator).
- `WatchApp` - Runs [dotnet watch](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/dotnet-watch?view=aspnetcore-3.0) on the application. Useful for rapid feedback loops.
- `WatchTests` - Runs [dotnet watch](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/dotnet-watch?view=aspnetcore-3.0) with the test projects. Useful for rapid feedback loops.
- `GenerateAssemblyInfo` - Generates [AssemblyInfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualbasic.applicationservices.assemblyinfo?view=netframework-4.8) for libraries.
- `CreatePackages` - Runs the packaging task from [dotnet-packaging](https://github.com/qmfrederik/dotnet-packaging). This creates applications for `win-x64`, `osx-x64` and `linux-x64` - [Runtime Identifiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog).  
    - Bundles the `win-x64` application in a .zip file.
    - Bundles the `osx-x64` application in a .tar.gz file.
    - Bundles the `linux-x64` application in a .tar.gz file.
- `GitRelease` - Creates a commit message with the [Release Notes](https://fake.build/apidocs/v5/fake-core-releasenotes.html) and a git tag via the version in the `Release Notes`.
- `GitHubRelease` - Publishes a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) with the Release Notes and any NuGet packages.
- `FormatCode` - Runs [Fantomas](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas) on the solution file.
- [`Release`](#Releasing) - Task that runs all release type tasks such as `GitRelease` and `GitHubRelease`. Make sure to read [Releasing](#Releasing) to setup your environment correctly for releases.

### Releasing

- [Start a git repo with a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Scaffold"
git remote add origin origin https://github.com/user/MyCoolNewLib.git
git push -u origin master
```

- [Create a GitHub OAuth Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)
  - You can then set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to upload release notes and artifacts to github
  - Otherwise it will fallback to username/password

- Then update the `RELEASE_NOTES.md` with a new version, date, and release notes [ReleaseNotesHelper](https://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/apidocs/fake-releasenoteshelper.html)

```markdown
#### 0.2.0 - 2017-04-20
- FEATURE: Does cool stuff!
- BUGFIX: Fixes that silly oversight
```

- You can then use the `Release` target.  This will:
  - make a commit bumping the version:  `Bump version to 0.2.0` and add the release notes to the commit
  - push a git tag

```sh
./build.sh Release
```
