# Getting Started

In this tutorial, we'll take a look at getting started with MiniScaffold and publishing your first library to NuGet and GitHub

## Prerequisites

- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/download)
- Install [.Net core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- If on macOS or Linux, install [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)
- If on Windows [ensure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed) you have at least .NET Full Framework 4.6.1 installed
- Recommended IDE is [VSCode with Ionide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/install-fsharp#install-f-with-visual-studio-code)
- Create a [NuGet account](https://www.nuget.org/)
- Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/)

## Installing MiniScaffold

Install the [dotnet template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates) from NuGet:

    [lang=bash]
    dotnet new -i "MiniScaffold::*"

Then use the template to create your own library.  Replace `MyCoolNewLib` with your own library name and `MyGithubUsername` with your own GitHub name. If you have trouble picking a library name then [generate one](https://colinmorris.github.io/rbm/repos/).

    [lang=bash]
    dotnet new mini-scaffold -n MyCoolNewLib --githubUsername MyGithubUsername
    cd MyCoolNewLib

This will generate a structure similar to this

    [lang=bash]
    .
    |-- Directory.Build.props
    |-- LICENSE.md
    |-- MyCoolNewLib.sln
    |-- README.md

    |       |-- types.fs
    |-- paket.dependencies
    |-- paket.lock
    |-- src
    |   |-- Directory.Build.props
    |   |-- MyCoolNewLib
    |       |-- AssemblyInfo.fs
    |       |-- Library.fs
    |       |-- MyCoolNewLib.fsproj
    |       |-- paket.references
    |-- tests
        |-- Directory.Build.props
        |-- MyCoolNewLib.Tests
            |-- AssemblyInfo.fs
            |-- Main.fs
            |-- MyCoolNewLib.Tests.fsproj
            |-- Tests.fs
            |-- paket.references

This may look overwhelming, but we don't have to worry about all of these yet.  Let's just focus on the real important ones for this tutorial.

- `./src/MyCoolNewLib` - This is where your library's source code will live.
- `./tests/MyCoolNewLib.Tests` - This is where your library's test code will live.
- `build.cmd` or `build.sh` - Platform specific entry points into your `build.fsx` file.
- `build.fsx` - The main build script of your repository.
- `README.md` - The text file that introduces and explains a project.
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md` - contains versioning, date, and release notes.

## Building your library

To make sure everything is functioning correctly, run the build command for your platform:

    [lang=bash]
    ./build.sh //for macOS or Linux
    .\build.cmd \\for Windows

You'll be flooded with a screen full of text, documenting the build processes at it currently stands. If it completes successfully you should be greeted with something similar:

    [lang=bash]
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Build Time Report
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Target                   Duration
    ------                   --------
    Clean                    00:00:00.0180266
    DotnetRestore            00:00:08.1013232
    DotnetBuild              00:00:09.2786467
    DotnetTest               00:00:07.9084110
    GenerateCoverageReport   00:00:00.8499974
    DotnetPack               00:00:06.3346539
    Total:                   00:00:32.6192299
    Status:                  Ok
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is FAKE telling us everything that ran, how long, and if it completed successfully.

If it does not complete successfully, either [open an issue](https://github.com/TheAngryByrd/MiniScaffold/issues) or ask on [F# Slack](https://fsharp.org/guides/slack/).


## Fill out README.md

The README.md comes with a lot of information but it's recommended to fill out the introductionary description.

## Making a Release

The release process is streamlined so you only have to start your git repository, set your NuGet and GitHub authorization keys, create release notes, and run the `Release` build target.

- [Create a GitHub Repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) and
[Start a git repo with your GitHub repository as a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)


    [lang=bash]
    git add .
    git commit -m "Scaffold"
    git remote add origin origin https://github.com/MyGithubUsername/MyCoolNewLib.git
    git push -u origin master

- [Create a NuGet API key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/publish-a-package#create-api-keys) and [Add your NuGet API key to paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/paket-config.html#Adding-a-NuGet-API-key)


    [lang=bash]
    paket config add-token "https://www.nuget.org" 4003d786-cc37-4004-bfdf-c4f3e8ef9b3a

- [Create a GitHub OAuth Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)
  - You can then set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to upload release notes and artifacts to github
    - If you're on a linux, you can put this key into your [.bashrc](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/129143/what-is-the-purpose-of-bashrc-and-how-does-it-work)
  - Otherwise it will fallback to username/password


- Then append to the top of the `RELEASE_NOTES.md` with a new version, date, and release notes. See  [ReleaseNotesHelper](https://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/apidocs/fake-releasenoteshelper.html) for more details. If appropriate, it's highly recommend adding a link to the Pull Request next to the release note that it affects.


    [lang=markdown]
    #### 0.2.0 - 2017-04-20
    - FEATURE: Does cool stuff!
    - BUGFIX: Fixes that silly oversight (https://github.com/MyGithubUsername/MyCoolNewLib/pull/001)


- You can then use the `Release` target.  This will:
  - make a commit bumping the version:  `Bump version to 0.2.0` and add the release notes to the commit
  - publish the package to NuGet
  - push a git tag


    [lang=bash]
    ./build.sh Release

## Done

You have now successfully created your first OSS library that has been published to NuGet and GitHub. Congratulations!
