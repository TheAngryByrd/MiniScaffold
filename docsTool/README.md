# Docs Tool

## Example 
[MiniScaffold docs example](https://www.jimmybyrd.me/miniscaffold-docs-test/)

## Docs High Level Design

This template is based heavily on [What nobody tells you about documentation](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/). In `docsSrc` folder you'll see a similar structure to what is described below:

- **Tutorials**
  - is learning-oriented
  - allows the newcomer to get started
  - is a lesson
  - Analogy: teaching a small child how to cook
- **How-To Guides**
  - is goal-oriented
  - shows how to solve a specific problem
  - is a series of steps
  - Analogy: a recipe in a cookery book
- **Explanation**
  - is understanding-oriented
  - explains
  - provides background and context
  - Analogy: an article on culinary social history
- **Reference**
  - is information-oriented
  - describes the machinery
  - is accurate and complete
  - Analogy: a reference encyclopedia article


The folders in `docsSrc` are:

- `content` - custom css, javascript, and similar go here.
- `Explanations` - A content section as defined above.
- `files` - extra files like screenshots, images, videos.
- `How_Tos` - A content section as defined above.
- `Tutorials` - A content section as defined above.
- `index.md` - The entry page to your documentation

The navbar is generated by the folders in docsSrc, excluding `content` and `files` folders.  Looking at the [example](https://www.jimmybyrd.me/miniscaffold-docs-test/) we can the navbar containing:

- `Api References`
- `Explanations`
- `How Tos`
- `Tutorials`

The odd one not generated from the convention of your folders in docsSrc is Api References.  This is generated by the [XML Doc Comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/codedoc) in your libraries under the `src` folder.
